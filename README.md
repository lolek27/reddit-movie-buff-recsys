# Introducing Reddit Movie Buff: Your Movie Recommendation Sidekick 🎬

Hey movie buffs! 🍿 Tired of hunting for your next movie night pick? Meet **Reddit Movie Buff** – your AI-powered movie buddy that makes choosing flicks a breeze. Whether you're craving a heart-pounding thriller or a feel-good rom-com, Reddit Movie Buff has got your back.

## What's the Scoop?

Think of Reddit Movie Buff as a smart twist on r/MovieSuggestions. It's a cool machine learning project that's all about suggesting movies you'll love – just like the Reddit crew does!

## 🎥 Created by a Movie Lover and Machine Learning Enthusiast

I'm Aleksandra, the movie-loving mind behind Reddit Movie Buff. As a dedicated cinephile with a passion for machine learning solutions, I wanted to create a tool that helps fellow movie enthusiasts find cinematic gems that match their mood and tastes. 


## How It Works

No fuss, no frills. Hop onto Reddit Movie Buff's user-friendly website. Type in your movie request, like you're chatting on Reddit. Hit that button and boom! Our AI engine kicks in, whipping up a list of awesome movie suggestions that match your request.

## Behind the Scenes

Our AI engine was trained using tens of thousands of movie requests and recommendations straight from Reddit's [r/MovieSuggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/) subreddit. That's why it's different than your usual recommendation systems - it doesn't use history of your ratings [it doesn't store anything], neither does it make you filter through genres or creators to get to a movie you want to watch. Because the engine stores the knowledge of the Reddit's movie community, it lets you search for what you'd like to watch like you were asking other reddit users - by simply putting in your request in natural language!

### Technical Details

### Known Limitations
The movies presented in search results come from Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. This makes latest movie releases absent from the recommendations, also accounting for some occasional unexpected results (for instance presenting older movies titles - sometimes unrelated to the topic - who just happened to share the title with a new release, missing from the movie db).

## Why Join?
